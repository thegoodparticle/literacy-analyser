# literacy-analyser

A python based Map-Reduce program to analyse the literacy rate among districts of a state

## Problem Statement
Given the MHA population dataset, find the impact of education policies implemented by the Government between 2001 to 2011

Data Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/mha-population-dataset

## Methodology
To find the impact of educational policies and to understand the ground-truth about the policy implementations on the population of the state, we are going to compare the literacy rate between 2001 and 2011.

Using Map-Reduce technique on the dataset, we will derive the literacy rate for each district for the Census Years in consideration.

## Implementation
Given dataset (in CSV format) on MHA population, contains multiple fields (refer: [resources/MHA_Population_Report.csv](https://github.com/thegoodparticle/literacy-analyser/blob/main/resources/MHA_Population_Report.csv)), out of which we are intereseted in the following fields.

| Census Year | District | Total literates | Total population |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
